# **All in One Guide**
## Why I made this site
As new users are coming and deciding to get into flashing custom ROM. I have decided to make this guide as most of the old guides have outdated things that can get you into trouble. **So I decided to make a new guide** 

**The device I have used is Xaga**

Many things have taken from old guides and I have just updated those and made a structured place to access them :)
